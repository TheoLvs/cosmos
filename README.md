# Cosmos

A ML library wrapper with the philosophy of fast.ai

# Introduction
Indeed, before using Deep Learning, Data Scientists often need to use simpler models. <br>
Yet there is no unified library allowing to do:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature engineering, feature selection and outlier detection
- Model fitting and AutoML
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Model explainability and interpretability
- Performance evaluation

## Philosophy
``cosmos`` goal is to stand on the shoulder of giants and not reinvent the wheel everytime you are doing a simple analysis. Hence, it will wrap code and functionalities from state of the art python libraries in 2019: 
- Scikit Learn mostly
- NLP libraries (NLTK, SpaCy)
- Plotly express and other visualisation libraries
- With compatibility with other ML libraries (Tensorflow, Pytorch) if needed
